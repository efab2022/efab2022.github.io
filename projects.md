# Projects

After finished an 18-months hands-on specialization course for advanced machine learning and deep learning, I wanted to publish a quick summary of projects and lessons learned.

## Sprint 0 - Admission Test - Implementing `K-Nearest Neighbors` from scratch

In 2022, as a prerequisite for admission, Turing College required the submission of a sample project, which allowed successful applicants to receive a 100% scholarship for their studies.

I am delighted to share that **my submission resulted in me being accepted with a 100% scholarship**.

This initial project required implementing the KNN clustering algorithm from scratch in pure python, without any external libraries (no `scikit-learn`, `numpy`,...) on the iris dataset.

**SUMMARY**: This challenge is designed to assess fluency and familiarity with software development, as well as the ability to learn new concepts and being able to apply them to solve a particular problem/task.

Despite being the first time I programmed in Python, my previous experience as a software developer was really useful and allowed me to implement a solution with relative ease. Looking back at the code I wrote over a year ago, it comes off as crude, and you can tell it is strongly influenced by other languages instead of using a
pythonic style.

Skills learned and applied
- Python
- Basic Data Structures and Algorithms
- Implementing a well known clustering algorithm from scratch.
- KNN Clustering
- Partial function application

**Reviewer's highlights**:

> Good points:
> - Very good understanding of the k-means algorithm
> - Ability to discuss each function in detail
> - Interesting comparison with the original labels
