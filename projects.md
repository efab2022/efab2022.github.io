# Turing College Projects

This page contains a summary of the projects submitted during this 18 months online self-paced bootcamp.

## Admission Test

In 2022, as a prerequisite for admission, Turing College required the submission of a sample project.

Turing College provided essential resources and theoretical knowledge, and successful applicants had a chance to
receive a scholarship for their studies.

This first project is for this Admission Test. I am delighted to share that my submission resulted in me being accepted
with a 100% grant for my studies.

### Sprint 0 - Implementing `K-Nearest Neighbors` from scratch

```python
from random import sample, seed
from typing import Iterable, Dict, Tuple

Point = Tuple[float, ...]
Centroid = Point
Clusters = Dict[Centroid, Iterable[Point]]

```

This initial project required implementing the KNN clustering algorithm from scratch in pure python, without any
external libraries (no `scikit-learn`, `numpy`,...) on the iris dataset.

**SUMMARY**: This challenge is designed to assess fluency and familiarity with software development, as well as the
ability to learn new concepts and being able to apply them to solve a particular problem/task.

Despite being the first time I programmed in Python, my previous experience as a software developer
was really useful and allowed me to implement a solution with relative ease. Looking back at the code I wrote over a
year ago, it comes off as crude, and you can tell it is strongly influenced by other languages instead of using a
pythonic style.

| Something I enjoyed | Learning a new language from scratch                                                   |
| Something I learned | KNN Clustering, Downloading datasets, Partial function application                     |
| Something fun       | I didn't know that the term was "Pythonic" so I wrote "python-esque" in some comments! |

| Something fun       | As someone who loves musical puns, this is the only dataset where I can have a variable called `the_corrs` to store correlations! |
