## Sprint 9 - Travel Insurance

**Project Requirements**: This is the first project where we can apply machine learning to perform market segmentation and customer analysis. The goal is to train a model to identify potential customers for a travel insurance, based on historical data.

**Key Learnings**:
- supervised machine learning
- model selection
- feature selection
- feature engineering
- business perspective: selecting a metric to measure success
- model evaluation
- ensemble models: bagging, boosting, ...
- creating custom loss functions


**Reviewer's highlights**:

> Score: 87

> - awesome business analysis and business requirement setting
> - I liked your modelling flow - goal setting, EDA, data preprocessing, modelling, eval --> iterate
> - loved your code. Great abstractions, OOP practices and generally - exemplary code quality
> - great advanced ML techniques, like custom scoring functions
